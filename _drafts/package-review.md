Well, not yet :D


Notes:

- Misconception: You don't need to be Red Hat employee
- You don't need to be an authority on the subject to do a review
- My package-review-tools project
- Fedora package review in Copr
- 30 minutes per day, only one ticket each day


Doesn't work:

- Monthly plan doesn't work
    - Leads to too much tickets in one weekend, boring, burnout
    - Too many juggled balls at the same time
- Sitting and waiting - ~5 reviews in 7 years
