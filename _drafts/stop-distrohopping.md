## Distro hopping is okay

- New to linux
- Taking a look isn't distro hopping
- Something completely different, e.g. NixOS, GNU/Guix, Silverblue
- Job, e.g. Gentoo -> Fedora


## My distro hopping journey

Slackware -> Ubuntu -> Debian -> Linux Mint -> Sabayon
-> Manjaro -> Arch -> Gentoo -> Fedora


## Problems with distro hopping

- Benefit is not as high as imagined
- Not needed for adding repos, changing WM, or customizations
- Not satisfying, people chase the first high and get addicted
- Always moving laterally
- No deeper knowledge
- Distro is not the end game
- No added value
- IMHO not truely learning
    - package managers are the same, just different syntax


## Get involved

- Packaging
- Review packages
- Send PRs for window managers and other tooling
- Localization
- Testing
    - Fedora test days
    - Bug reproducing
- Help newbies on IRC/Matrix/Mailing list
- Write documentation
    - There are missing pages or sections
- Write blog posts
- Do graphics


## What's in it for you?

- Being productive, having impact and meaning in life
- Finding a job
- Define the future
- Giving back to the community
