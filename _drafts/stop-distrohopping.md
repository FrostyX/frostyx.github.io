I spend a lot of time on Reddit, Mastodon, and Youtube and
frequently come accross people switching from one GNU/Linux
distribution to another. Asking for recommendations. Of course,
they are free to do whatever they want and assess their reasons
for hopping by their own ...
I'd like to recommend an alternative which I think is more
meaningful.


## Distro hopping is okay

Before burning me at the cross like a heretic, please let me
acknowledge there are good reasons for distro hopping.

For instance, frequently switching distributions is a great
learning experience for new linux users, as a form of an
exposure therapy. It can help with the fear of installing
operating systems, give an opportunity for a do-over for common
pitfalls such as imperfect disk partitions. I'll help you
explore what distributions are out there, get familiar with
their strenghts and weakneses, and have tho knowledge in the bank.
Once new use-case arises (you need to deploy a server, some IoT
device, hack your car ...), you already know the best tool for the
job.

Some distributions are just different and there is no way to
recreate the experience. If an immutable distribution is the best
choice for your situation, switching from Fedora Workstation to
Fedora Silverblue is a no-brainer. If reproducibility has the
utmost value, ditching your standard distributions for NixOS might
be a good idea. If you want your perfect Lisp machine, GNU Guix
will get you there.

Distro hopping because of a new job is perfectly justifiable
as well. I loved my Gentoo dearly and would be using it till
the end of days. However, after getting hired by RedHat to work
on an RPM packaging ecosystem, it just doesn't make sense to
run anything else on my workstation othen Fedora.

Distributions also come and go. You don't have to use
Mandrake Linux just because that's what you've always used.
In fact, you probably shouldn't.

The last point that I want to address is that installing
a distribution in a VirtualBox machine just to take a quick
glance at what is new, and then deleting the machine isn't
something I would consider to be distro hopping.


## My distro hopping journey

My journey started in 2008 by installing Slackware on a PC
that my friends assembled basically out of garbage. Then
migrating my Laptop from Windows Vista to Ubuntu. I hopped
Kubuntu because it looked cooler, and Debian because of the
joke that "Ubuntu is an ancient African word, meaning - I can't
configure Debian". I hopped to CrunchBang because #! was l33t.
I hopped to Sabayon because Gentoo was too scary, and then I
hopped to Arch because I wanted to tell people, that _I use
Arch btw_. Then I hopped to Gentoo because it was the only
thing left to conquer. Finally, I hopped to Fedora because of
my job.

As you can see, I did plenty of distro hopping and I had
only the best of reasons for doing so.


## Problems with distro hopping

- Benefit is not as high as imagined
- Not needed for adding repos, changing WM, or customizations
- Not satisfying, people chase the first high and get addicted
- Always moving laterally
- No deeper knowledge
- Distro is not the end game
- No added value
- IMHO not truely learning
    - package managers are the same, just different syntax


## Get involved

- Packaging
- Review packages
- Send PRs for window managers and other tooling
- Localization
- Testing
    - Fedora test days
    - Bug reproducing
- Help newbies on IRC/Matrix/Mailing list
- Write documentation
    - There are missing pages or sections
- Write blog posts
- Do graphics


## What's in it for you?

- Being productive, having impact and meaning in life
- Finding a job
- Define the future
- Giving back to the community
