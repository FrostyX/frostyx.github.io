<h2>School</h2>
<p>As the high school I attended <a href="http://sps-br.cz/" title="sps-br.cz">SPŠ in Bruntál</a>. I graduated with the project of school canteens web allowing online meal orders for students and teachers. Since I like studying and love IT I decided to go on university. So in the present I attend the <a href="http://www.inf.upol.cz/" title="inf.upol.cz">Department of Computer Science</a> on the Palacky Univesity. Currently I am working on my bachelor theis called "Determine applications affected by upgrade". See my <a href="/projects" title="FrostyX's projects">projects</a> page for more informations.</p>
